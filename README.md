Welcome to Cosmic Realm! Made by jkodelm on GitHub.

## DESCRIPTION: ##

Cosmic Realm is a space simulation featuring numerous UFOs and various interface elements. You can create any environment you desire, and it is highly customizable.
Add UFOs and create your own as much as you want. Change the background and simulate interstellar battles (nothing too crazy tho).

## HOW TO USE ##

Execute Cosmic_Realm.py.

You only need to install the modules 'Pillow' (for image management) and 'CustomTkinter' (for a better tkinter interface). The code cannot work without Pillow, although you can remove all CustomTkinter instances and replace them with tkinter elements.

For developers, docstrings and comments should be straightforward and easy to understand.

## CUSTOMIZATION ##

You have plenty of resources you can change, here's a quick explanation below.

- Cosmic_Realm.py: A few actions can be removed or added (4 lines), you have a comment on what they do next to them.
- CR_Variables.py: Many variables you can change to your liking, explained there as well. Colors, spawn rate and a lot of settings avaiable.
- bgs folder: You have 4 backgrounds you can change, preferably with 1920x1080 dimensions. _previews were made using an app to resize images, you must change it yourself too.
- ufos folder: UFOs images, 160px width, but the app should resize it. I recommend setting a 5px gap between all sides (so the skin is 150px wide) to avoid slight visual glitches.

## USAGE ##

Feel free to use it with credit as long as you do not upload it as your own :)
